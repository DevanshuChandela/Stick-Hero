## 🕹️ Stick Hero
Simple & Addictive Bridge-Building Game

## 🎮 Gameplay
Press and hold to grow a stick horizontally from your platform.
Release to drop the stick—it becomes a bridge.
If the stick length is just right, the hero crosses safely; otherwise, he falls.
Earn more points with long, precise bridges across random platform gaps.

## ⚙️ Features
Procedural platform generation for endless variety.
Intuitive click‑and‑hold controls.
Smooth JavaFX graphics with minimalistic style.
Sound effects for stick growth and hero movement (if audio is included).
Track high scores.

## 🧠 How It Works
Scene setup: Main_Game initializes the JavaFX window and components.
Input handling: On mouse press, a Stick grows; on release, it drops.
Hit detection: Checks if the drop lands within the next platform’s range.
Movement: Hero auto-walks across a valid bridge.
Scoring: Each successful bridge adds +1 to the score; long, accurate bridges yield more.
Game over: A fall triggers a reset screen to restart and retry your best.
